U.S. Congressional Districts as Hexagons.
=============

The purpose of this map as detailed in here on [Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/03/1389806/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presents-the-best-map-ever-of-United-States-congressional-districts) (where the map actually comes from) is to represent the congressional districts in the United States accurately. Currently it is difficult to show the districts because some such as those in New York City are very small, while others like Montana are the size of an entire state. Previosly the maps needed to be zoomable to see the districts containing cities. Other represntations such as cartograms warped the country's shape. This map attempts to fix that by giving each congressional district equal area i.e. five regular hexagons.

According to the original Daily Kos article, the map was built by [Daniel Donner](http://www.dailykos.com/user/Daniel%20Donner).
